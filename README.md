🍔 Zomato Data Analysis — Because Food > Everything

Welcome to my Zomato Data Analysis Project — where numbers meet noodles 🍜 and statistics meet samosas 🥟.
This project dives deep into Zomato restaurant data to uncover which restaurants rule our hearts (and stomachs).

🎯 Project Goals

To answer life’s greatest questions like:

Why do I always end up ordering paneer tikka again?

Which restaurant type gets the most love (and votes ❤️)?

Are online orders secretly getting higher ratings?

How much do couples spend when they say “let’s just order something light”? 😂

🧾 Dataset Info

The dataset comes from Zomato and includes columns like:

Restaurant type (Delivery, Dining, Buffet… all the fancy stuff)

Rating (like your mom’s “beta 5/5”)

Votes (because opinions matter 🍕)

Cost for two (that mysterious number that somehow doubles by dessert 🍰)

Online / Offline orders

🤓 Questions Answered

1️⃣ Which type of restaurant do people order from the most?
2️⃣ How many votes did each type of restaurant get?
3️⃣ What are the most common ratings?
4️⃣ How much do couples spend when they order online? 💑
5️⃣ Which mode (online/offline) got the chef’s kiss of ratings? 😘
6️⃣ Which restaurant types got more offline love — so Zomato can drop them some spicy offers 🌶️

📊 Sneak Peek of Findings

🥇 Dining wins the popularity contest — because ambience + AC = happiness.

💬 Most ratings hover between 3.5 – 4.0 — the sweet spot of “not bad, not great, will still order again.”

💑 Couples spend a decent amount online — probably still cheaper than going out 😂.

🌐 Online orders got slightly higher ratings — because no one likes waiting for a table.

🏠 Some restaurant types still prefer the offline life — maybe they just love human contact.

🧹 Data Cleaning (aka “Kitchen Hygiene”)

Before cooking the insights, we cleaned the mess:

Removed /5 from ratings (because math > emojis).

Converted cost columns to numbers.

Checked for missing data (we found some “invisible restaurants” 👻).

Aggregated votes and ratings by restaurant type.
